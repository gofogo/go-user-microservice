# User Microservice In Go

This is a simple user managment microservice written in Go. On its own this service does not provide much value but it can be used as a fundamental building block of a much more complex application.

# WARNING

This service seems stable but it has never been tested in production environments. Use with caution! Provide patches and fixes in your pull requests.
